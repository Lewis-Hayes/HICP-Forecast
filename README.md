# Euro Area Inflation Forecasting Model

## Overview
This comprehensive forecasting system predicts Euro Area inflation using a robust machine learning pipeline that:
- Integrates economic data from multiple sources (FRED API and Excel)
- Performs advanced time series preprocessing
- Trains and compares multiple machine learning models
- Implements a stacking ensemble for improved accuracy
- Provides uncertainty quantification with Bayesian methods
- Features a retraining system for ongoing model maintenance
- Generates both MoM (Month-over-Month) and YoY (Year-over-Year) forecasts

## Key Features
- **Data Integration**: Combines 17+ economic indicators from FRED and custom Excel data
- **Advanced Preprocessing**: Automatic stationarity transformation with ADF/KPSS tests
- **Feature Engineering**: Creates meaningful interaction terms and lag features
- **Model Stacking**: Combines XGBoost, CatBoost, and SVR with Bayesian meta-model
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Provides 90% confidence intervals for forecasts
- **Retraining System**: Automatic model updating with performance tracking
- **Visual Analytics**: Generates forecast visualizations with interpretation

## Methodology
### Data Pipeline
1. **Data Collection**: 
   - FRED API for economic indicators
   - Excel integration for money supply data
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Calculates YoY and MoM inflation
   - Creates interaction terms (e.g., Energy_Commodities Ã— EUR_USD)
   - Generates lagged features (1-3 months)
   - Adds rolling statistics (3-month mean/std)
3. **Stationarity Transformation**:
   - Automated differencing with ADF/KPSS tests
   - Problematic feature removal
   - Linear interpolation for missing values

### Modeling Approach
1. **Model Selection**:
   - Bayesian-optimized XGBoost, CatBoost, SVR, and MLP
   - Quantile regression for uncertainty estimation
2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation
3. **Ensemble Construction**:
   - Manual stacking with out-of-fold predictions
   - Bayesian Ridge meta-model for uncertainty-aware predictions
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Time-series cross-validation
   - Comprehensive metrics (RMSE, MAE, MAPE)

### Production Features
- **Retraining System**: Automatic model updating with new data
- **Performance Tracking**: Stores historical metrics
- **Drift Detection**: Identifies data distribution shifts
- **Forecast Interpretation**: Provides economic insights
